# BaryoDev Learning System

This directory contains the AI's learning artifacts.

## Structure

- `logs/` - Work logs for each task
- `mistakes/` - Mistake reports and root cause analysis
- `skill-proposals/` - Proposed updates to BaryoDev skills
- `metrics.json` - Learning metrics and progress tracking

## How It Works

1. **After every task**: AI creates a work log documenting what went right/wrong
2. **After every mistake**: AI creates a mistake report with root cause analysis
3. **When learning**: AI proposes skill updates
4. **With approval**: AI creates PRs to BaryoDev/skills
